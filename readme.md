# Ashwet kini's Portfolio
Welcome to My 3D Developer Portfolio!
I'm passionate about creating immersive 3D experiences using GLSL shaders, Three.js, and WebGL. This portfolio is a curated showcase of my skills in real-time graphics, shader programming, and interactive web development.

Here, you’ll find a collection of my side projects, video game prototypes, and creative experiments—all built with modern 3D technologies. From an interactive Rubik's Cube to a fully functional arcade machine, each piece reflects both my technical abilities and personal interests in gaming and visual design.

Whether you're a fellow developer, recruiter, or just curious about 3D web development, explore my journey and discover how I bring ideas to life through code and creativity.
You can now explore it [here].
